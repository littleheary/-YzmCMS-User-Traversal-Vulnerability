# -YzmCMS-User-Traversal-Vulnerability
> [Suggested description]
> The forgotten-password feature in index.php/member/reset/reset_email.html in YzmCMS v3.2 through v3.7
> has a Response Discrepancy Information Exposure issue and an unexpectedly long lifetime for a verification code, which
> makes it easier for remote attackers to hijack accounts via a brute-force approach.

> [Additional Information]
> 1. The verification code at the forgotten password can be used to
> capture the packet without refreshing the page, so that the current
> verification code is valid for a long time, so as to achieve the
> purpose of bypassing the verification code for blasting.

> 2. Forgotten password will return different response data according to
> different account conditions. When the user name does not exist, it
> will prompt "Username does not exist". When the user name exists, it
> will prompt "Email failed" or "Email sent successfully". ".
>
> 3. Through different response data contents, it is possible to
> directly burst out the existing account information.

> Vulnerability introduce:
> Account traversal by not bypassing the verification code by refreshing the page
>
> the step is :
> 1 Open the retrieve password page, simulate normal input, and input "user name" and "verification code";
> 2. Capture the packet in burp to truncate the current request;
> 3. the current data packet sent to the intruder module, identification "username" used to traverse account information;
> 4. Select the dictionary for the account name to open the attack;
> 5. Check the blasting result;
> Attempting to perform 972 explosions without prompting "Invalid verification code"
> The non-existent user data is 1929. The response package prompts "The user does not exist!"
> The length of the existing user data is 1956, and the response package prompts "The e-mail failed. Please contact the webmaster!"
> In this way, you can successfully traverse the user name that exists in the dictionary
